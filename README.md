# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This website functions as a basic note taker app. It allows users to create a note with a title and content and save it in a JSON file using Express.js to manipulate the data on the server. Saved notes can be both viewed and deleted by the user.
I have worked with third-party API's before, this is my first time as a developer creating and interacting with a REST API. This website is also deployed using heroku which hosts and handles server-side operations. Although this is a simple application, it still utilizes both front-end and back-end methods. Through developing this app, I felt as though I had reached a new milestone in my journey as a developer.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

In order to use this app, the user should first navigate to <https://boiling-everglades-64675.herokuapp.com/>

They will be greeted by a splash screen welcoming them to the Note Taker. After pressing ```Get Started```, they will be relocated to the main page where they will have the ability to view or delete notes already present on the server and post new notes of their own.

The sidebar to the left displays the notes currently present in the database JSON file. Clicking on the tile will display the title and contents of that note in the main text field. Clicking the red trash icon to the right will delete that note from the database.

To create a new note, press the ```+``` icon on the top right of the screen. The notes field will be cleared of any content and the user is free to add text of their own. A save button will appear at the top right only once both the ```Note Title``` and ```Note Text``` fields are populated.
